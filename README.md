# ML-Practice
This repo contains all the projects I taught at iCode!\
Each branch contains a project, so you need to switch branches to see them.\
Each project/branch contains a readme of instructions/things learned/notes and a source .py file.



Libraries used:\
Pandas\
Numpy\
Sklearn\
Tensforflow\
Matplotlib

General stuff I learned (more details in the readme for each branch):\
2 Types of learning, supervised and unsupervised. Supervised is better for smaller data sets. Supervised includes any Classification algorithms, so Lin Reg, Random Forest, KNN, NB, etc. Unsupervised includes stuff like clustering. 

Overfitting is when the program too closely follows the model. All it knows is the data points given by the model, so it sucks at classifying any new info bc it has a big sum of residuals. Overcomplicates the problem (ie. too many patterns to classify by, too specific, think about the face recognition model you made and the params it takes. "It's only a lego if it has exactly 4 nubs")
Underfitting oversimplifies the problem. It sucks at classifying bc there's too few patterns to classify. Ie. just a linear straight line thru the model function. Too vague, think "if it's rectangular, it's a lego"
