# ML-Practice
Practice side projects using common ML libraries like Pandas, Sklearn, etc.\
These are all projects I taught while teaching at iCode!! :)\\

Each branch contains its own project, so you need to navigate thru the branches. 

Libraries used:
Pandas
Numpy
Sklearn
Tensforflow
Matplotlib

Random notes/refreshers:
2 Types of learning, supervised and unsupervised. Supervised is better for smaller data sets. Supervised includes any Classification algorithms, so Lin Reg, Random Forest, KNN, NB, etc. Unsupervised includes stuff like clustering. 


Overfitting is when the program too closely follows the model. All it knows is the data points given by the model, so it sucks at classifying any new info bc it has a big sum of residuals. Overcomplicates the problem (ie. too many patterns to classify by, too specific, think about the face recognition model you made and the params it takes. "It's only a lego if it has exactly 4 nubs")\
Underfitting oversimplifies the problem. It sucks at classifying bc there's too few patterns to classify. Ie. just a linear straight line thru the model function. Too vague, think "if it's rectangular, it's a lego"\
Bias vs. Variance
